        I enjoy ...
    </h3>
    
    <h4> Walking</h4>
    <p> Walking not only gives me an opportunity to enjoy some sunlight,
        but it is also a way to get some steps in and participate in 
        a form of physical activity. Walking is also a form of relaxation for me 
        - as I often listen to music while walking.
