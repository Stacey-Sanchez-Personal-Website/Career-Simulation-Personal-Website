    <h3>Things I have Built</h3>

    <h4>Zoo Problem</h4>
    <p>For this project, we practiced important HTML concepts
        such as the use of headings, semantic tags, and making ordered lists.
        Additionally, we practiced inserting photos and external links to our
        HTML files. With the use of these topics, we created a webpage for new
        zookeepers so that they may familiarize themselves with the different animals
        and learn more about them.

    <h4>Grocery List</h4>
    <p>For this project, we again practiced the use of different HTML tags, including unordered and
        ordered lists. Additionally, semantic tags were used to create sections for the
        different types of food items to be purchased. Unlike the Zoo Problem project, howevever, CSS styling
        was added and linked to the HTML file. Properties such as font and background color were applied. The box model
        was also used to add borders and spacing between sections.

    <h4>Secure the Vault</h4>
    <p>Lastly, for this project, we began our practice of JavaScript. We created variables that would hold the values
        of the resulting arithmetic and with that, also practiced using the different artihmetic operators. The variable
        values
        had to be equal to one of the codes provided. The goal was to display an alert message on a webpage which would
        inform
        webpage visitors of the 3 codes. The message was created using the alert function, which took in variables and
        strings
        in order to create its output - the message with the secret combination.
